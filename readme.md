1. Google Sheets Setup:
First, set up the Google Sheets with the following column headers:

Column	Description
Task ID	Auto-generated unique identifier for each task
Task Name	Name or description of the task
Assigned To	Team member responsible for the task
Due Date	Date when the task is due
Priority	Priority level of the task (High, Medium, Low)
Status	Current task status (To-Do, In Progress, Completed)
Progress	Completion percentage of the task (0-100%)
Comments	Additional notes or remarks on the task
2. Formulas to Use:
1. Auto-Generate Task ID:
In Cell A2, use this formula to auto-generate Task IDs:

excel
Copy
Edit
=IF(B2<>"", ROW()-1, "")
This formula will generate a unique Task ID based on the row number.

2. Status Formula:
In Cell G2 (Status column), use this formula to automatically update the status based on the progress:

excel
Copy
Edit
=IF(F2=100, "Completed", IF(F2>=50, "In Progress", "To-Do"))
This formula checks the Progress (Column F) and updates the Status (Column G) accordingly:

If Progress is 100%, it shows "Completed".

If Progress is 50% or more, it shows "In Progress".

If Progress is below 50%, it shows "To-Do".

3. Completion Rate:
In Cell F101 (or any cell below your data), use this formula to calculate the average task progress:

excel
Copy
Edit
=AVERAGE(F2:F100)
This formula calculates the average completion rate for all tasks in Column F.

4. Count of Tasks by Status:
To count the number of tasks in each status (e.g., "Completed"), use the following formula in any cell:

Count of "Completed" Tasks:

excel
Copy
Edit
=COUNTIF(G2:G100, "Completed")
Count of "In Progress" Tasks:

excel
Copy
Edit
=COUNTIF(G2:G100, "In Progress")
Count of "To-Do" Tasks:

excel
Copy
Edit
=COUNTIF(G2:G100, "To-Do")
5. Conditional Formatting:
You can apply Conditional Formatting to highlight tasks based on priority or status.

For example, to highlight tasks with "High" priority:

Select Column E (Priority).

Go to Format > Conditional Formatting.

Under "Format cells if", choose Text contains and enter High.

Choose a color to highlight.

Similarly, you can apply conditional formatting for "Completed" tasks to mark them as green.

3. Using Data Validation:
To add a dropdown for Priority and Status:

Priority Dropdown:

Select Column E (Priority).

Go to Data > Data Validation.

Under Criteria, select List of items and enter High, Medium, Low.

Click Done.

Status Dropdown:

Select Column G (Status).

Go to Data > Data Validation.

Under Criteria, select List of items and enter To-Do, In Progress, Completed.

Click Done.

4. Google Apps Script (Optional):
To automate email notifications or reminders when a task is due, you can use Google Apps Script. Below is an example script to send an email reminder for overdue tasks:

javascript
Copy
Edit
function sendDueDateReminders() {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("Sheet1");
  var data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  
  var today = new Date();
  
  for (var i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
    var dueDate = new Date(data[i][3]); // Due Date in Column D
    var email = data[i][2]; // Assigned To email in Column C
    
    if (dueDate < today && data[i][6] !== "Completed") {
      var subject = "Task Reminder: " + data[i][1]; // Task Name in Column B
      var body = "Dear " + data[i][2] + ",\n\nThis is a reminder that your task \"" + data[i][1] + "\" is overdue. Please update the task status.\n\nBest Regards,\nTask Tracker";
      MailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body);
    }
  }
}
To set up this script:

Go to Extensions > Apps Script.

Paste the script above into the editor.

Save the script and set a trigger to run it daily by clicking on the clock icon (Triggers) and setting the frequency to Daily.

5. Google Sheets Filters:
You can use the built-in Filter functionality in Google Sheets to filter tasks by Priority, Status, or Due Date.

For example, to filter tasks by Priority:

Click on the filter icon in the header row of Column E (Priority).

Choose Filter by condition and select your criteria (e.g., High priority).

6. How to Set Up and Use the Task Tracker:
Create Your Sheet:

Open a new Google Sheets file.

Set up the columns and formulas as described above.

Input Data:

Enter task information into the sheet, and the Task ID will be auto-generated.

Update the Progress column as tasks are worked on.

Automated Status Update:

The Status column will automatically update based on the Progress column using the formula.

Monitor and Filter Tasks:

Use filters to view tasks by Priority or Status.

Track overall completion with the Completion Rate formula.

Set Up Notifications:

Use the Google Apps Script (optional) to send email reminders for overdue tasks.
